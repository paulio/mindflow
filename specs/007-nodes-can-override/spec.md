# Feature Specification: Node Border Colour Overrides & Hierarchical Defaults

**Feature Branch**: `007-nodes-can-override`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Nodes can override their border colour using a colour selection in the Detail pane. By default each nodel cihld level is represented by a different colour. Once the default colours have been exchausted the next colour choice wraps back to the starting colour."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user editing a graph, I want each node to have a meaningful default border colour based on its depth level in the hierarchy, but also be able to manually override a node's border colour via the Detail pane so that I can visually categorize or highlight specific nodes beyond the automatic scheme.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a graph with a root node and newly created child nodes, **When** I add children at successive depth levels, **Then** each node receives an initial default border colour determined by its depth using the defined palette (depth % paletteLength) and after exhausting colours the assignment wraps from the start.
2. **Given** a selected node in the Detail pane, **When** I choose a different border colour (palette swatch or valid hex), **Then** the node's border updates immediately and is marked as user-overridden.
3. **Given** a node (default or overridden), **When** I re-parent it to a different depth, **Then** its displayed border colour does not change automatically (no implicit recolouring after placement).
4. **Given** a node with an override, **When** I clear the override (reset action), **Then** the node's border colour reverts to its originally assigned default colour (the colour captured at initial assignment) even if its depth has changed since.
5. **Given** a deeply nested hierarchy exceeding the palette length, **When** new deeper nodes are created, **Then** their initial defaults continue wrapping deterministically (depth % length) ensuring reproducible results.
6. **Given** I perform an undo after changing a node's border override, **When** the undo executes, **Then** the node's prior colour state (value + override flag) is restored in a single step.

### Edge Cases
- Palette Exhaustion: Very deep depth values still map correctly using depth % paletteLength; verified for large depths (e.g., 10,000).
- Invalid Palette Configuration: If palette list missing or length = 0, system uses root colour (#1e222b) for initial assignment; if individual index missing, also fall back to root colour (#1e222b).
- Re-parenting: Moving nodes does not alter any existing colour (default or overridden) post initial placement.
- Reset After Re-parent: Clearing override restores the node's original initial default colour (captured at creation) even if depth changed.
- Undo/Redo: Each committed override change (apply or clear) is one undo step; no partial intermediate values.
- Custom Hex Input: Invalid hex entries ignored silently (no change) until a valid 7‚Äëchar #rrggbb submitted.
- Single Parent Assumption: Feature assumes strict tree; cycles or multiple parents are invalid and out of scope.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST assign a default border colour to each node at creation based on its depth using `(depth % paletteLength)` over the defined palette order.
- **FR-002**: Palette MUST be the same sequence used for existing node colours: `["#1e222b","#2d323f","#444b5a","#556070","#6b7687","#8892a0","#b48ead","#a3be8c","#d08770","#bf616a"]`.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow a user to override a node's border colour via the Detail pane choosing either a palette swatch or a valid custom hex (`^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$`).
- **FR-004**: Override selection MUST update the node border immediately (no intermediate flicker or delay).
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist: originalDefaultColour (initial assigned), currentBorderColour, overrideFlag (boolean), paletteIndex (initial depth % length).
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT auto-change a node's border colour after initial assignment due to depth changes (no passive recolouring).
- **FR-007**: Clearing an override MUST restore the node's originalDefaultColour (captured at creation). If missing, recompute using current depth mapping.
- **FR-008**: Initial colour assignment MUST be deterministic: identical hierarchy at creation time yields identical colours.
- **FR-009**: Each completed override action (apply new override or clear override) MUST be one undo/redo unit.
- **FR-010**: If palette list is invalid or length = 0, system MUST fall back to root colour `#1e222b` for new assignments (and record paletteIndex = 0); if a specific index lookup fails, also fall back to root colour `#1e222b`.
- **FR-011**: Colours MUST be stored as hex strings; paletteIndex stored separately for defaults.
- **FR-012**: Multi-node (batch) border override editing is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this iteration.
- **FR-013**: Different colour alone indicates override; no additional badge or icon required.
- **FR-014**: System MUST assume a single-parent tree; nodes having more than one parent are invalid input.
- **FR-015**: Once a node is created, only explicit user override or reset may change its border colour.
- **FR-016**: A palette length of zero SHOULD be treated as a configuration error but handled gracefully (see FR-010) without crashing.

### Non-Functional / Constraints
- **NFR-001**: No explicit performance target required for this iteration; operations SHOULD remain responsive under typical graph sizes (<200 nodes).
- **NFR-002**: Undo/redo MUST be idempotent (re-applying state does not re-trigger extra computations).
- **NFR-003**: Palette MUST be defined in one location to prevent divergence (single source of truth).

### Key Entities
- **Node**: id, parentId, children[], depth (at creation), paletteIndex, originalDefaultColour, currentBorderColour, overrideFlag.
- **Colour Palette**: Ordered list of hex colour strings used for initial depth-based assignment.

### Derived Rules
- Initial Mapping: `originalDefaultColour = palette[ depth % palette.length ]` captured once at creation.
- Display Colour: If `overrideFlag=true` ‚Üí `currentBorderColour = userOverrideColour`; else `currentBorderColour = originalDefaultColour`.
- Reset Override: Set `overrideFlag=false`, `currentBorderColour = originalDefaultColour`.
- Missing Palette Entry: If paletteIndex out of range, use root fallback `#1e222b`.
- Invalid Palette (empty): Use root colour `#1e222b` for new nodes (still record paletteIndex = 0).

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-01
- Palette: Fixed 11-colour sequence `["#0e4ee6ff","#225a0cff","#c2961fff","#556070","#6b7687","#8892a0","#b48ead","#a3be8c","#d08770","#bf616a","#99c7ffff"]`.
- Behaviour Adjustment (Post-implementation): Override selection affects the border (accent) only; the "Colors" section sets background fill. (Label in UI will be corrected to avoid confusion.)
- Initial assignment only uses depth at creation; later depth changes do not auto recolour.
- Single parent tree; multiple parents / cycles out of scope.
- Multi-node batch editing: Out of scope this iteration.
- Override indication: Different colour alone (no badge/icon).
- Fallbacks: Empty palette or bad index ‚Üí root colour `#1e222b`.
- Undo granularity: One undo per completed override apply or clear.
- Storage: Hex strings plus recorded paletteIndex and originalDefaultColour at creation.
- Post-placement changes: Only explicit user override/reset can change colour.
- Collaboration: No multi-user considerations in scope.
